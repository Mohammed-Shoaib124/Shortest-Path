# Shortest-Path
This project implements various algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph.

## Overview
This project embodies an algorithmic implementations geared towards discerning the shortest path within graph structures. This encompass the accumulation of inter-city distances, weather data, and sea-level information, meticulously validated via a dedicated Load Data Program.
This repository contains a collection of well- known algorithms that can find the quickest path between graph nodes. The accuracy and effectiveness in validation mechanisms, is demonstrated by the combination of these algorithms.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
Java Development Kit (JDK): Download here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

Use online gdb to run all the files
https://www.onlinegdb.com/

## Input
- City1 - source
- City2 - destination 

## Output
- Path from city1 to city2
- Distance travelled
- Gasoline usage in gallons


## Steps
- Extract all the files of the project 
- Then upload all the files in online gdb
- Run Main.java
- Enter the source city
- Enter the destination city
- A path from source to destination is given
- Distance travelled between source and destination 
- Gasoline usage in gallons is specified
- If you want to travel to another city, enter y(yes) otherwise n(no)
